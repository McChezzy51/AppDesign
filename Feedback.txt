Design Text Feedback

- Unclear if hot lunch refers to both counter food and food in the hot boxes such as hot dogs and chicken tenders, or if items such as cakes and yogurt in the fridges are also counted
- Design is clear overall and understandable, seems very useful for students
- If a meal has different options, will they be listed as different items, or will there be sub-options, for example, if the meal was pasta and meatballs, but there was a vegan meatball option, how would that be displayed?

Design Video Feedback

- How will students access the app, since phones are banned on campus? Is it supposed to be accessed when at home and then remember, or is it intended to be used in the caf

Overall

- Visuals and design are very clear in intention and execution plans
